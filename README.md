## Features

- Maximizes screen space. There are no margins on the screen, as the nice!view's borders gives some already.
- The layer text is right there in a large font, and it also lets you see your current layer path (up to 10 layers currently)
- The turtle from Google's Noto Emoji is there for the secondary display.
